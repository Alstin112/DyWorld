[list]
[*] Completely new setup and rewrite
[*] Improved Statistics and Level window
[*] New level mechanic. still in WIP state, but will be used for unlocks, bonuses and more
[*] Needs system. Still under construction, but working already a bit (at least the losing hunger and thirst stats) Currently off normally, since doenst add any gameplay yet that works like it should
[*] Tiered Entites and Items: because of the rewrite, i changed the setup how this is done. It is still in its early stages, but works fine. It adds 9 tiers of multiple machines and items with technologies and graphicals automatically. Currently supported: Assembling Machines, Solar Panels, Accumulators, Logistics Bots, Construction Bots, Mining Tools. (recipes are currently not good. Will be fixed in 0.3.1 update!)
[*] Added a distance window. This works with the map tags you make on the map screen, but also helps you find the shipwrecks
[*] Shipwrecks are now closed but way more random. One can be close to you, while other 2 are 500 meters away.
[*] loads of changes in the scripts to make everything more fluent. Including, but not limited to, refreshing stats window (every sec), better calculations and much more
[*] First basic items of the needs system. they are of no use yet!
[*] probably more, but working on this over the course of 4 months every now and then :)
